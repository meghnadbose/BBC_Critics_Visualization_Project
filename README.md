<h1>On the BBC's list of 'The 21st Century's 100 Greatest Films', did film critics tend to choose more films by directors from their countries? This project finds out.</h1>

<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>

- In 2016, the BBC published a list of "the 21st century's 100 greatest films"
- 177 critics polled from 36 countries around the world
- But wait, are critics more likely to pick films “from their countries”?

<h2>How did I do this?</h2>

- Step 1: Scrape the BBC’s page and create a dataframe of all the info on the page
- Step 2: Think of a proxy for the data we‘re looking for!
- Step 3: Scrape a ﻿secondary data source and find the birthplace of the directors
- Step 4: Join the two dataframes!
- Step 5: Sanity checks: Does our data seem correct? How do we know?
- Step 6: Create the map

<h2>The Visualization</h2>
What does it show us?

- Hover over any country and find the number of directors’ films were picked by critics from that country
- Click on any country and on the right, you will find a list showing how critics from that country made their picks, filtered by, you guessed it, country!
